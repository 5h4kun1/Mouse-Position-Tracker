## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-Phase Recording**: Track mouse positions across multiple separate recording sessions
- **Interval-Based Tracking**: Record positions at customizable intervals (default: 0.5s)
- **Real-Time Display**: Live X, Y coordinate updates during tracking
- **Phase Transitions**: Automatic prompts to move to different positions between phases
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded status indicators for each recording state

### Advanced Features
- **Always on Top**: Keep the tracker visible above all windows
- **Customizable Settings**:
  - Start delay (preparation time before recording)
  - Duration per phase (recording time)
  - Recording interval (frequency of position capture)
  - Number of phases (separate recording sessions)
  - Transition delay between phases (time to reposition)
- **Auto-Save**: Automatically save logs with timestamped filenames
- **Manual Save**: Export logs to custom locations (.txt or .csv format)
- **Statistics**: View average positions, ranges, and totals for each phase
- **Phase Grouping**: Logs organized by phase for easy analysis

### User Interface
- Clean, intuitive Tkinter-based GUI
- Color-coded status indicators (Orange=Transition, Red=Recording, Green=Complete)
- Progress timer with countdown display
- Phase indicator showing current phase number
- Scrollable log viewer with formatted output
- Professional data formatting with headers and separators

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mouse-tracker.git
cd mouse-tracker
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install pynput
```

**Note**: `tkinter` is usually included with Python. If not installed:
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
- **Fedora**: `sudo dnf install python3-tkinter`
- **macOS/Windows**: Included by default

### Step 3: Run the Application
```bash
python mouse_tracker.py
```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Configure Settings**:
   - Set start delay (default: 3 seconds) - Time to prepare before recording
   - Set duration per phase (default: 5 seconds) - How long each phase records
   - Set recording interval (default: 0.5 seconds) - Time between captures
   - Set number of phases (default: 3) - Total recording sessions
   - Set transition delay (default: 3 seconds) - Time to move between phases

2. **Start Tracking**:
   - Click "‚ñ∂ Start Multi-Phase Tracking"
   - Wait for countdown to complete
   - Move mouse naturally during recording phase
   - Status will show "üî¥ RECORDING PHASE X..."

3. **Phase Transitions**:
   - After each phase completes, status shows: "‚è≥ NOW MOVE TO DIFFERENT POSITION!"
   - Reposition your mouse during the transition countdown
   - Next phase begins automatically after countdown
   - Process repeats for all configured phases

4. **Save Results**:
   - **Auto-save** (if enabled): Creates timestamped file `mouse_multiphase_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`
   - **Manual save**: Click "üíæ Save Log" to choose custom location and filename
   - **Clear log**: Click "üóëÔ∏è Clear Log" to reset and start fresh

### Example Use Cases

Phase 3: Record inventory button position
Phase 4: Record menu navigation positions
```

#### UI Testing
```
Phase 1: Record login button locations
Phase 2: Record menu interactions
Phase 3: Record form field positions
Phase 4: Record submit button locations

Phase 2: Track mouse movement in top-right quadrant
Phase 3: Track mouse movement in bottom regions
```

#### Hardware Programming (ATtiny85/Digispark)
```
Record exact positions for programming USB HID devices
to automate mouse movements in games or applications
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Settings Breakdown

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Start Delay | 3 sec | 0-60s | Time before first recording starts |
| Duration per Phase | 5 sec | 0.1-300s | How long each phase records |
| Record Interval | 0.5 sec | 0.01-10s | Time between position captures |
| Number of Phases | 3 | 1-50 | Total recording sessions |
| Transition Delay | 3 sec | 0-60s | Time to move between phases |
| Always on Top | ‚úì | On/Off | Keep window above others |
| Auto-save | ‚úì | On/Off | Save automatically after completion |

### Recording Interval Tips
- **0.01-0.1s**: Very detailed tracking (100-10 points/sec) - for precise movements
- **0.5s**: Balanced tracking (2 points/sec) - recommended for most uses
- **1-2s**: Sparse tracking (1-0.5 points/sec) - for general position marking

## üìä Log Format

The application generates formatted logs with:
- Session timestamp and configuration
- Phase-separated coordinates
- Individual point timestamps
- Statistical summaries per phase
- Overall averages and ranges
